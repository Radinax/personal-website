        I had the pleasure of working with Adrian on a few projects, even though
        we were on separate teams. Adrian proved to be a dedicated and reliable
        teammate, consistently showing great ability in solving problems and
        implementing requirements.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to his technical skills, he also demonstrated strong
        leadership abilities, effectively guiding and motivating the team to
        achieve our project goals. Adrian is a skilled web developer with a
        strong attention to detail and a passion for delivering high-quality
        work.
        <br />
        <br />
        It was a pleasure to work with Adrian and I would highly recommend him
        for any team looking for a dedicated, talented, and leadership-focused
        web developer.

        Adrian has a lot of experience with React. He knows everything that
        needs to be known and all of the catchiest things. He always tried to
        make the code better and find better ways to do things.
        <br />
        <br />
        But beyond his technical skills, what really stood out to me was his
        concern for the team. He was always willing to lend a helping hand to
        anyone who needed it and was always looking out for the best interests
        of the team as a whole. He always tried to help with team organization
        and make things easier for the other developers.

His ethics and sense of organization makes him go beyond being a simple developer that gets the job done. He is well suited to manage a team of people and provide valuable input from the product itself to choosing the right tool to organize a team to choosing the right approach to develop entire features. If you're tempted to include him in your team, do it. You're not going to regret it. I would work with him again and again until AI destroy us all.",

        Adrian was quickly promoted to Capnote's Front End Tech lead after
        showing his senior tier knowledge in React, work ethics, high drive and
        commitment to take a leadership's role.
        <br />
        <br />
        He delivered plenty of complex features intended for the Capnote
        dashboard in schedule, meeting all the client's requirements. I also
        believe his experience as an engineer teaching a physics's course at the
        local college allowed him to properly mentor junior devs teammates, as
        they increasingly improved and started contributing on their own.
        <br />
        <br />
        Regardless Adrian's mainly focused on Front End, He owns the talent and
        perseverance to produce quality work on any field in web development, if
        not, software engineering in general. I have no qualms in asking him for
        guidance in regards of webdev tech stacks.

        Adrian has a great talent for software development, and problem solving,
        showing great skills to build complex UI functionalities, and always
        caring about code quality. Besides he has showed a great level of
        commitment towards the project, working even many extra hours to get the
        work done and keep the clients satisfied.
        <br />
        <br />
        He has also shown great leadership in the front end team and the
        capacity to know when to delegate a task to the ideal teammate.
        Proactivity is one of its greatest values, He's always participating and
        collaborating with all the parties involved in the project to make sure
        that the client is getting the product they need. Proposing ideas,
        defining and assigning tasks among many others, are the things he's
        usually doing besides his front-end lead role.

        Since I have the opportunity to work with Adrian, I can excel his
        leadership into the developer team, always showing a path to follow and
        he has the important attribute to listen any suggestions.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the other hand, he has strong tech knowledge in Front End
        Technologies like React.Js, Redux Toolkit & Typescript. With him I've
        taking the opportunity to get more experience as a Developer and
        Professional, he always has a good way to delivery any rich advices, for
        that reason I feel really comfortable to work with him and pretty sure
